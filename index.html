			<h3>VEX IQ BOT</h3>
			<p>
				VEX IQ is based on plastic, snap-together pieces specifically designed to build highly functional robots. This system doesnâ€™t require any prior knowledge in robotics. Students can easily build their first robot, and the wide variety of additional parts means that they can build anything they imagine as they continue to learn. Every kit includes a hand tool to make assembly and disassembly easy for small hands.
